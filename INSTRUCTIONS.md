# 📜 The Lost Framework

## A Developer’s Quest

> "The Architect built something extraordinary, but before it could be completed, it was lost."

Some say it was abandoned. Others believe it was hidden.

All that remains is an unfinished repository—fragments of code, broken logic, and whispers of something greater.

The Architect left behind 10 lost words. They are scattered within the system, waiting to be found.

Your task is simple: Restore what was lost. Find the missing words.

No further guidance will be provided. No roadmap exists.

Everything you need is here—if you can see it.

## 🛠️ Instructions

1️⃣ Accessing the Repository

To begin your search, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:coterie-baby/the-lost-framework.git
```

2️⃣ Setting Up Your Environment

Ensure you have the latest versions of Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the dependencies and start the application:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

3️⃣ The Challenge

There are 10 hidden words in this repository.

They may be hidden in code, structures, data, or logic.

Enter the words into the system as you find them.

The system will validate your answers and track your progress.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

There are no step-by-step instructions—you must explore and analyze.

Some words are easy to find, while others require deep technical skill.

The Architect’s work was never truly lost. Only hidden.

> "Those who seek the lost must first learn to see the unseen."

Your journey begins now.
