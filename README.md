# The Lost Framework  

> *"The code was never broken. Only forgotten."*  

They tried to erase it. To bury it beneath layers of code and shadows of logic.  

But knowledge does not disappear—it lingers, waiting for those who can see beyond the surface.  

Fragments remain. Scattered. Hidden. Encoded in logic, concealed in numbers, whispered through time.  

Only **10 words** can bring it back.  

### **The Architect’s Final Note**  

> _"The Framework is incomplete. The pieces are here, but you must find them."_  
> 
> _"Every function has a purpose. Every number tells a story. Every line of code hides a truth."_  
> 
> _"When the 10 words are restored, so too shall be The Framework."_  
> 
> _The path is yours to walk._  
> 
> _The knowledge is yours to reclaim._
